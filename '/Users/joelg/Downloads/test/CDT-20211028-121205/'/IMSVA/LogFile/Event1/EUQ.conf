# Ha, you're reading this config file looking for the easy way out!
# "how do I make my apache server go really really fast??"
# Well you could start by reading the /manual/misc/perf-tuning.html
# page.  But, we'll give you a head start.
#
# This config file is small, it is probably not what you'd expect on a
# full featured internet webserver with multiple users.  But it's
# probably a good starting point for any folks interested in testing
# performance.
#
# To run this config you'll need to use something like:
#     httpd -f /usr/local/apache/conf/highperformance.conf
